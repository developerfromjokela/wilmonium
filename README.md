# Wilmonium
Wilmonium, Chrome & Firefox extension for improving Wilma experience in your browser

## Features

### Anti session timeout

This feature prevents the Wilma session from time-outing. It also does this in the background, so you don't have to log in to Wilma each time.

No more lost message drafts and annoyance.

### Dark mode

Currently the following pages are styled properly:

- [x] /
- [x] /messages
- [x] /messages/xxx
- [x] /schedule
- [x] /choices (HOPS text color is incorrect, everything else works)
- [x] /exams/calendar
- [x] /exams/calendar/past
- [x] /attendance
- [x] /attendance/view
- [x] /decisions
- [x] /printouts
- [x] /feedback (not tested) 
- [ ] ... other pages in the dropdown menu
- [x] dropdown and popup elements

I am also planning to add light/dark mode switch and reduce theme flickering on page change.
